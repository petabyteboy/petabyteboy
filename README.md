### Hi there, I'm Milan ✨

**Many of my projects are hosted over at [git.petabyte.dev](https://git.petabyte.dev/petabyteboy/). If something you are looking for isn't here, I have probably moved it there.**

I'm non-binary. My pronouns are **they/them/...**. If your language doesn't have any common gender-neutral pronouns, you may use male or female pronouns, but gender-neutral pronouns are preferred.

I'm mostly a networking person. Many of my projects are related to network visualisation, such as [HopGlass](https://github.com/hopglass/), a tool widely used by wireless mesh networking projects across Germany. But I'm also a NixOS user, enthusiast and contributor. Declarative infrastructure deployment is the future. 🚀

At day I build train-wayside communication systems at [nyantec](https://nyantec.com/) 🚈💨, at night I establish independent infrastructure, like the experimental autonomous network [AS207921](https://bgpview.io/asn/207921).
