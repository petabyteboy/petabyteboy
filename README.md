### Hi there, I'm Milan ‚ú®

**Many of my projects are hosted over at [git.petabyte.dev](https://git.petabyte.dev/petabyteboy/). If something you are looking for isn't here, I have probably moved it there.**

I'm non-binary. My English pronouns are **they/them/...**. In general I prefer gender neutral pronouns, but if your language doesn't support them, <strike>you may use female or male pronouns</strike> you should really consider recompiling your language with extended support for pronouns.

I'm mostly a networking person. Many of my projects are related to network visualisation, such as [HopGlass](https://github.com/hopglass/), a tool widely used by wireless mesh networking projects across Germany. But I'm also a NixOS user, enthusiast and contributor. Declarative infrastructure deployment is the future. üöÄ

For work I build train-wayside communication systems at [nyantec](https://nyantec.com/) üöàüí®, in my spare time I establish independent infrastructure, like the experimental autonomous network [AS207921](https://bgpview.io/asn/207921).
