### Hi there, I'm Milan ✨

**Many of my projects are hosted over at [git.pbb.lc](https://git.pbb.lc/petabyteboy/). If something you are looking for isn't here, I have probably moved it there.**

I'm non-binary. My pronouns are **they/them/...**. Using the correct pronouns is not optional. If your language doesn't have any common gender-neutral pronouns, you may use male pronouns, but gender-neutral pronouns are preferred.

I'm mostly a networking person. Many of my projects are related to network visualisation, such as [HopGlass](https://github.com/hopglass/), a tool widely used by wireless mesh networking projects across Germany. But I'm also a NixOS user, enthusiast and contributor. Declarative infrastructure deployment is the future. 🚀

At day I build train-wayside communication systems at @nyantec 🚈💨, at night I establish independent infrastructure, like the experimental autonomous network [AS207921](https://bgpview.io/asn/207921).

If you are interested in any of my networking projects or want to talk to me for any other reason, you may contact me on any of the following platforms:
- XMPP: [petabyteboy@petabyteboy.de](xmpp:petabyteboy@petabyteboy.de)
- IRC: pbb on Freenode
- Email: [github@pbb.lc](mailto:github@pbb.lc)
- Telegram: [@petabyteboy](https://t.me/petabyteboy)
- Matrix: [@mil:nyantec.com](https://matrix.to/#/@mil:nyantec.com)

Oh, and if you haven't noticed by now: ɹǝǝnb ɯ,I
